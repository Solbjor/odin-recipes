    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 1:</h3>
            <p>Cook the rice using your preferred method. I recommend using a stovetop pot method as the rice comes out much smoother and tastier.</p>

            <h3>Step 2:</h3>
            <p>Cook the beans in a pot overnight, adding in various flavourings and vegetables of your choosing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 3:</h3>
            <p>Chop up the bell pepper, cilantro, and onion into small square pieces. Set them aside for when the mixing begins.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 4:</h3>
            <p>Add the rice and beans into a pot set to low heat. Toss in the chopped up bell pepper, onion, and cilantro. Add in Salsa Lizano in variable amount depending on your preference and mix it all.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 5:</h3>
            <p>Turn off the stove and serve with eggs and tortillas!</p>
